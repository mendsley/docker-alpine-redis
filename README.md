`docker pull redis:alpine`

TL;DR - Use the `alpine` tags from https://hub.docker.com/_/redis instead

This repository is deprecated. When I initially created it, there was not a redis-on-alpine docker image easily available. Now, the canonical redis image has an alpine tag, and as a standard docker image, it should carry more trust than my personal image.
